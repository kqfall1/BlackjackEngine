I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DOUBLE DOWN NEAR THE END BECAUSE THE DEALER HAD INSUFFICENT CHIPS. I UTILIZED THIS MEMBER OF DECK TO ACCOMPLISH THIS: 
internal Card DrawAce() //USED PURELY FOR DEBUGGING SPLIT HANDS.
{
    Card firstAceInDeck = cards.FirstOrDefault(card => card.Rank is Rank.Ace); 

    if (firstAceInDeck is not null)
    {
        cards.Remove(firstAceInDeck);
    }
    
    return firstAceInDeck; 
}
